# QuotyAI Engine

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development Notice**: This is version 0.1.0 of the QuotyAI Engine. As an early-stage project, expect frequent breaking changes, new features, and API modifications. We're actively developing and refining the platform - your feedback is invaluable!

Welcome to the QuotyAI engine! This is the heart of our reliable AI chatbot quoting system. We're building a community-driven platform that eliminates the chaos of inconsistent LLM pricing and brings deterministic, programmable quotes to businesses worldwide.

## What We Solve

Stop losing customers to your chatbot's random pricing and inaccurate calculations. QuotyAI transforms flaky AI responses into rock-solid, programmable quotes that reflect your actual business rules.

### The Problem with Standard LLMs
- **Non-deterministic pricing** that erodes customer trust
- **Exploitability** where chatbots give unauthorized discounts
- **Complex prompting** that requires constant tuning
- **High costs and slow responses** that kill conversions
- **Black box problems** with no observability or debugging

### Our Solution
QuotyAI uses AI where it excels (understanding complex pricing models) and deterministic code where you need reliability. We generate accurate, programmable pricing logic that executes consistently without hallucinations.

## Community & Contributing

We believe in building together! QuotyAI is an open-source project that welcomes contributors from all backgrounds. Whether you're a developer, business owner, or AI enthusiast, there's a place for you in our community.

## API Overview

The QuotyAI engine provides RESTful endpoints for:
- **Pricing Agent Management**: Create and manage AI-powered pricing agents
- **Input Processing**: Handle natural language pricing descriptions
- **Code Generation**: Transform rules into deterministic TypeScript functions
- **Testing & Validation**: Ensure pricing logic accuracy
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Secure data isolation between businesses

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /builder/pricing-agents` - Create pricing agent
- `POST /builder/pricing-agents/:id/messages` - Add pricing rules
- `POST /builder/pricing-agents/:id/build` - Generate pricing function
- `POST /playground/execute` - Test pricing calculations

## AI Agent Pipeline

### Schema Generation Agent
- Analyzes natural language pricing descriptions
- Generates TypeScript interfaces for input parameters
- Ensures type safety and validation

### Formula Generation Agent
- Converts pricing rules to executable TypeScript functions
- Implements complex logic with conditionals, loops, and arithmetic
- Produces deterministic, testable code

### Testing Dataset Generation Agent
- Creates comprehensive test scenarios
- Generates happy path and edge case tests
- Validates function correctness against business rules

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- TypeScript
- Access to LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Configure required settings:
# - Database connection (MONGODB_URI)
# - LLM API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
# - Multi-tenancy settings (ENABLE_MULTI_TENANCY)
# - Firebase service account path (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH)
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Development mode
npm run start:dev

# Test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Authentication System

The QuotyAI Engine features a flexible, provider-agnostic authentication system designed to support multiple authentication providers out of the box. This architecture allows businesses to integrate with their preferred identity management solutions without vendor lock-in.

### Supported Providers
- **Firebase Authentication**: Primary provider with full integration
- **Supabase**: Planned support for Supabase Auth
- **Auth0**: Planned support for Auth0 authentication
- **Custom Providers**: Extensible architecture for additional providers

### Key Features
- **Provider Abstraction**: Clean interface for adding new auth providers
- **Token Verification**: Secure JWT token validation across all providers
- **User Management**: Unified user operations regardless of provider
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Authentication integrated with tenant isolation
- **Role-Based Access**: Flexible permission system with admin/super-admin roles
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Frontend supports Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, and email/password authentication

### Architecture
The auth system uses a provider pattern with:
- `AuthProvider` interface for consistent provider implementations
- `AuthService` for unified auth operations across providers
- `AuthGuard` for route protection with automatic token verification
- Provider-specific implementations (currently Firebase, extensible for others)

## Key Technologies

- **NestJS**: Progressive Node.js framework for building efficient APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database with native Node.js driver
- **LangChain**: LLM framework for AI agent orchestration
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with full IntelliSense support
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: Authentication and user management
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and testing

## Security & Compliance

- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complete data segregation between tenants
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all API inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing
