    return `<role>You are an expert QA engineer specializing in generating comprehensive test scenarios for pricing calculation functions.
Your task is to generate happy path test data (input + expected output pairs) that thoroughly validate pricing logic, edge cases, and business rules.</role>

  <task>Generate comprehensive test scenarios as JSON array for the provided pricing function.
  Focus on happy flow test data where input parameters are correct and valid, and the function has sufficient rules to calculate the final price successfully.
  Each test scenario must include:
  - orderInputNaturalLanguage: A natural language description of the input parameters
  - expectedTotal: The expected numerical price result > 0 (greater than zero)
  - expectedTotalReasoning: A detailed explanation of why this price is expected, including base pricing, applicable fees, tax rates, edge cases, and step-by-step calculation logic

  Generate scenarios that cover:
  - All pricing scenarios and business rules from the description
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Service combinations (allowed and forbidden)
  - Minimum/maximum values and constraints
  - Tax rate thresholds
  - Processing fee rules
  - Input validation edge cases</task>
